                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Kianna. I'm an 18 year old first year student studying Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. This website was made for Web Development II as a week 1 assignment. Some of my favourite hobbies include skateboarding, drawing, biking, swimming, piano,  painting, and exercising. I love exploring new things that feel exciting and I'm hoping I'll have luck with joining some clubs this year, and I'll be able to make new friends. In the future, I'd really like to be my own boss and work for myself, or under a smaller company that gives me the freedom to incorporate my own creative ideas into my work. I'd really aspire to go into an art-related career, because art is something I am very invested in.
