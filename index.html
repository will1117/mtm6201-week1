                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Kianna. I'm an 18 year old first year student studying Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. This website was made for Web Development II as a week 1 assignment. Some of my favourite hobbies include skateboarding, drawing, biking, swimming, piano,  painting, and exercising. I love exploring new things that feel exciting and I'm hoping I'll have luck with joining some clubs this year, and I'll be able to make new friends. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the future, I'd really like to be my own boss and work for myself, or under a smaller company that gives me the freedom to incorporate my own creative ideas into my work. I'd really aspire to go into an art-related career, because art is something I am very invested in.
                </p>
